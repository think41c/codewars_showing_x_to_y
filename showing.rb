# A category page displays a set number of products per page, with pagination at the bottom 
# allowing the user to move from page to page.
# Given that you know the page you are on, how many products are in the category in total, 
# and how many products are on any given page, how would you output a simple string showing which products you are viewing..
# In a category of 30 products with 10 products per page, on page 1 you would see
# 'Showing 1 to 10 of 30 Products.'
